# 68HC12-Power-Plant
Junior level ECE project that modeled a power plant with the Motorola 68HC12 Micro controller architecture and instruction set using: a hex-keypad for user input, LCD for menu and human machine interface, stepper motor to simulate generator doors unlocking, locking, and the filling of the generators, a DC motor that simulated the plant output, a push button that initiated generator filling, dip switches to control generator status and an auto-shutoff feature, LEDs that indicated generator statuses and capacity, visually indicate which generators are being manipulated through switches, etc., a speaker that plays various noises when a shutdown occurs, a generator auto-shutoff occurs, or if the filling process is running, and the RTI was implemented to keep track of time and various delays while the IRQ served as the emergency shutdown.
